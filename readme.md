# Bevy Scene Hot-reloading
Tiny plugin that respawns `Scene`s that have `AssetEvent::Modified` sent out, allowing scene hot-reloading.
This does not apply for `DynamicScene`s, which already have native hot-reloading support.

I will keep this up to date with the latest Bevy version until it is no longer needed.

Current Supported Bevy Version: `0.16`
